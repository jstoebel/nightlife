# MERN template

This is my template for MERN stack applications. In a sea of choices that is the Javascript/React ecosystem I wanted an example app that utilizes current libraries in a way that make sense to _me_. While there are things like `create-react-app` and [mern.io](http://mern.io/). The underlying assumption for those solutions is that the developer doesn't want to bother with all of the implementation details of getting a MERN app off the ground. While that viewpoint has merit, I wanted to understand how technologies like ES6, Webpack, React, JSX, Redux (and on and on and on...) all fit together. This app serves as a learning experience for how to piece together those technologies, a reminder when I am stuck later on, and, most importantly, a jumping off point for spinning up new apps. This app might not include _everything_ that a MERN developer might need, but I can say confidently that I understand fully everything in this app, which, I think is the more important thing.

## Influences

Creating this sample app, I drew on many resources and tutorials. Some were so influential that they are worth mentioning here:
 - [Hackathon Starter](https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter)
 - [Refactoring a Basic, Authenticated API with Node, Express, and Mongo](http://blog.slatepeak.com/refactoring-a-basic-authenticated-api-with-node-express-and-mongo/)
 - [Building a React/Redux App with JSON Web Token (JWT) Authentication](http://blog.slatepeak.com/build-a-react-redux-app-with-json-web-token-jwt-authentication/)
